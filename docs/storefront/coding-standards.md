# Coding standards

## Eslint

It can show you errors on demand when writing your code - you have to install an editor plugin to use it. It can be used on the server-side in any test.

Rules are defined in files `.eslintignore` and `.eslintrc.js`.

## Prettier

You can format your code on save or be fired by a key shortcut - you have to install an editor plugin to use it.

Rules are defined in files `.prettierignore` and `prettier.config.js`.

## Editorconfig

Adds coding standards into your IDE even if you don't have any plugins installed.

Rules are defined in file `.editorconfig`.
