# Coding standards

## Eslint

Can show you error on demand when writing your code - you have to install an editor plugin to use it (can be used on server-side in any test).

Rules are defined in files `.eslintignore` and `.eslintrc.js`.

## Prettier

Can format you code on save or can be fired by a key shortcut - you have to install an editor plugin to use it.

Rules are defined in files `.prettierignore` and `prettier.config.js`.

## Editorconfig

Adds coding standards into your IDE even if you don't have any plugin installed.

Rules are defined in file `.editorconfig`.
